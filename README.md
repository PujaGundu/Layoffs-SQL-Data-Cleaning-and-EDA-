# Layoffs-SQL-Data-Cleaning-and-EDA-
Project Overview
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a large dataset capturing layoffs across various companies globally. The dataset includes information such as company name, location, industry, total layoffs, percentage of workforce laid off, date, company stage, country, and funds raised.

The goal was to prepare the dataset for insightful analysis by addressing data quality issues and then exploring the data to uncover patterns in layoffs by industry, geography, time, and company characteristics.

Data Cleaning :
-- 1.Remove Duplicates
-- 2. standartize the data
-- 3. remove null values or blank values
-- 4. remove columns which are unnecesary


EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis):

-- Here we are just going to explore the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers

-- normally when you start the EDA process you have some idea of what you're looking for

-- with this info we are just going to look around and see what we find!
